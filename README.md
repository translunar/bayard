# bayard

This is just a simple script for comparing covariance growth during
dead reckoning between different IMUs.

Note that the Matlab script has the gyroscope functionality and the
Python script contains accelerometer functionality. I cannot vouch for
the reliability of the Python script, as the paper it came from is
incomplete.

## Usage

    python bayard.py
